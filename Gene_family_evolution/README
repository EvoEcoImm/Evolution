This folder contains evolutionary analyses of gene family, Phylosignal and CAFE analysis.

The Phylosignal subfolder contains R scripts used to produce the Figure S2.

The CAFE subfolder contains CAFE script "Running script for CAFE" to produce all expansion and contraction of gene families except signaling genes in JAK-STAT, Toll and IMD pathways, and that have low variance in gene numbers and involve more than one pathways.
