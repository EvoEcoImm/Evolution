phylobayes version 4.1

init seed : 211916

data file : orthov4.phylip
number of taxa : 30
number of sites: 22898

fast computation / high memory use 

fixed tree topology: Treeforphylobayes

branch lengths ~ iid gamma of mean mu and variance epsilon*mu^2
mu ~ exponential of mean 0.1
epsilon ~ exponential of mean 1

site homogeneous model: free equilibrium frequencies (pi inferred from data)
pi ~ uniform

relative exchange rates:
empirical (jtt, Jones et al 1992)

rates ~ gamma of mean 1 and variance 1/alpha
4 discrete categories (Yang 1994)
alpha ~ exponential of mean 1

flexible, non-autocorrelated clock (uncorrelated gamma)
variance parameter sigma^2 ~ exponential of mean 1

calibrations : calibration
soft bounds (Inoue et al 2009)
allowing for 2.5 % of probability mass outside calibration (2.5% on each side for an upper and lower bound)
lower bounds as in Paml 4.2 (truncated Cauchy), p = 0.1 and c = 1
prior on root age: improper uniform
WARNING: you should probably define a prior on root age using -rp <mean> <stdev>

WARNING: it is always advised to check the prior on divergence times in the presence of calibrations, by using the -prior option

prior on divergence times : birth death
birth rate : lambda
death rate : mu
sammpling fraction : rho
p1 = lambda - mu: net growth rate
p2 = lambda * rho
prior on p1 : gamma of mean 0.001 and std dev 0.001
prior on p2 : gamma of mean 0.001 and std dev 0.001
